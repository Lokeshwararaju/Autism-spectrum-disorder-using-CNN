## Autism Spectrum Disorder using CNN
# Objective:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early detection of ASD is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes.
# Problem Statement:
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by challenges in social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive behaviors. Electroencephalography (EEG) has emerged as a promising tool for investigating brain function and potential biomarkers associated with ASD. EEG captures the electrical activity of the brain.
# Programming Language:
